## Summary of Project

#### Project name: Aircraft Fighter Simulation Using Machine Learning

Nowadays Using machine learning methods at simulations systems gets importance with spreading and growing  machine learning methods. Main purpose of using simulations is getting big gain from can cause of a lots of material and spiritual damages. Simulations can use at military sector as can use at too diverse areas. developing project at defense industry mostly develop as closed source code. So can see open source development at defense industry is necessary. we build a project that responding the to these problems. the project uses web api for getting weather at real time and uses system time for get three times of day. uses twelve different simulation environment form three times four. uses Reinforcement learning for training enemy planes. Main motivation of using RL at the project is successful.  Used Unity3D game engine, C#(generally) language and Unity Toolkits(MLagents, postprocessing). Aim of authorized person of using aircraft is destroy the enemy aircrafts. The Simulation supported in English and Turkish. Also developed as supporting other languages structure.  The using main aircraft person can control with arduino based joystick and keyboard horizontal, vertical buttons.
